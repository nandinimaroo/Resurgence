## Gameplay Overview

### Level 1: Hospital Corridor

Agent X navigates a chilling hospital corridor infested with Unity AI-generated zombies. The primary objective is to capture these zombies by knocking them down. However, the challenge escalates as each captured zombie carries a countdown timer. When the timer hits zero, the zombie becomes toxic, posing a direct threat to Agent X. Progressing to the next level requires capturing at least one zombie while ensuring the others are subdued or eliminated.

### Level 2: Laboratory

The journey continues in a laboratory where Agent X discovers Dr. Grey's crucial notes on treating the captured zombies. Successful treatment requires Agent X to stay within the range of a control unit. The catch is that toxic zombies relentlessly attack in the confined laboratory space, injecting urgency into the mission. Players must adeptly balance treating captured zombies with surviving the onslaught of toxic threats.

## Game Dynamics

The game operates on a life-based system. Agent X has three lives in total, and losing a life occurs if Agent X succumbs to the toxic zombies. Players also face limited bullets, adding strategic depth to the gameplay. Losing a life prompts a restart from the initial hospital corridor level, maintaining a sense of challenge and replayability. Exhausting all lives results in the ultimate loss of the game.

_Resurgence_ skillfully weaves together suspense, strategy, and survival elements, offering players an emotionally charged, empathy inducing gaming experience. Navigate through the grim remnants of civilization, embarking on a mission to save humanity from the impending zombie menace with Agent X.
